# Lung Cancer Detection (practice programs)

My PhD research title is “Automated framework for predicting the Lung Cancer Using Deep Learning Approach”. The purpose of this project is to develop a model that utilizes various concepts from image processing, data mining, machine learning, and deep learning to detect lung cancer nodules amongst high risk patients. Various concepts of image processing are also utilized. Currently I am reviewing the ML & DL approaches used in cancer progression modeling. The predictions addressed are mostly linked to specific ML, input, and data samples supervision.

Dataset utilised is: https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/?CollectionCriteria=LIDC-IDRI (LIDC - IDRI DATASET)
